Separation of Concerns (SoC):
    - The class appears to separate concerns related to database operations from other parts of the application. 
      It focuses on tasks such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records in the database.

    - Each method in the DatabaseManager class seems to have a single responsibility related to database management tasks, 
      such as importing data, retrieving records, updating rows, and deleting records.
